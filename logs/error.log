	<li>The elegance of this framework is in its mobility. You can deploy it anywhere with ease since it is written in PHP</li>
	<li>SkullyMVC was never intended for complex module-inheritance system. There is no core module anywhere. It is simply a skeleton to help you started on an MVC structure.</li>
	<li>Treat the code just like one of your own. Edit anything you feel required. Add <strong>ANY</strong>&nbsp;PHP plugin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SkullyMVC is not Wordpress, either</h2>

<ul>
	<li>There is a reason this framework is called SkullyMVC, not SkullyCMS. Nope, you won&#39;t get CMS-like capabilities, not directly as you install, anyway.</li>
	<li>Instead, with this piece of framework you can build anything you like. You can quickly build your own Multi-language CMS with this. Do you want a CMS without database? Yes you can have it directly? Do you want a shopping cart? With some effort, sure you can build it yourself.</li>
